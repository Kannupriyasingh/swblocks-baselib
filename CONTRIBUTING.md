## Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to swblocks-baselib!

swblocks-baselib is built on and intended for open source and we fully intend to accept public contributions in the near future. Until then, feel free to file issues and open pull requests, but note that we won't be merging them until the necessary processes are in place.

If you are currently J.P. Morgan Chase employee and interested in contributing you can contact [Lazar Ivanov](https://github.com/lazar-ivanov) about more details on the process and governance of contributions from current J.P. Morgan Chase employees.

The swblocks-baselib library comes with a comprehensive unit tests suite and virtually all parts of it are very extensively tested. It also comes currently with a couple of application binaries - 'bl-tool' and 'bl-messaging-broker'.

In order to be able to make changes to the library code and contribute these back you will need to be able to modify and add to the tests code suite and also of course be able to build and run the unit tests suite, etc. The library comes also with its own flexible make files and build system which allows you to build these binaries and unit tests suite.

More details on how to be able to build and execute the unit tests suite will be coming soon
